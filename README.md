# course-v4 - Fork for Colab users
In this fork, the notebooks will be edited for setting up on Google Colab. Pull requests and issues with suggestions are welcome! UPDATE: Just noticed it is not possible to open issues in forks, but feel free to contact me in the fastai forum: @wittmannf.

## Direct links for opening on Colab
The following links will open the notebooks that have been set up so far directly on Google Colab:
- [01_intro_colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WittmannF/course-v4/blob/master/nbs/01_intro_colab.ipynb)
- [02_production_colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WittmannF/course-v4/blob/master/nbs/02_production_colab.ipynb)
- [04_mnist_basics_colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/WittmannF/course-v4/blob/master/nbs/04_mnist_basics_colab.ipynb)

Alternativelly, you can head to the folder [nbs](https://github.com/WittmannF/course-v4/tree/master/nbs) above, select the the notebook and click in "Open in Colab" (only those covered in class so far will have the button):

## Updates
- In order to make it easier to merge updates from the original branch into the fork, all of the adapted notebooks will be renamed adding the suffix `_colab.ipynb` in the end.
