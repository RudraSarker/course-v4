# course-v4 - Fork for Colab users
In this fork, the notebooks will be edited for setting up on Google Colab. Pull requests and issues with suggestions are welcome! UPDATE: Just noticed it is not possible to open issues in forks, but feel free to contact me in the fastai forum: @wittmannf.

## Direct links for opening on Colab
