# Deep Learning for Coders
- Starter Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ao9E-yVfTt5TzTKmnjrVQqi5rphZMYFb#scrollTo=3Y_nNqeTOL4S
## First half: 
- Discussion, datasets, material and charts about corona virus.
## Second Half
- Intro about DL
- Top Down Methodology: We are going to "play bat" with SoA models
- Basics of Jupyter and Python
- Jupyter is a REP-Loop environment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop
- Suggestion: Duplicate notebooks when running experiments. 
- [ ] TODO: Questionarie in the end of each class 
- Basics of Neural Networks
- Basics of Machine Learning
- NOTE: The 2 will be gone in the gone from fastai2 library
- Metamodel: from fastai.vision.all import *
- `valid_pct`: portion of the dataset that is going to be used for validation

## Next Class
- We will build a production model with transfer learning that can be put on the internet.
